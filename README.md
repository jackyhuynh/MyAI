# data_science_and_visualization
A collection of data science and data visualization, machine learning application using: R, Python, Seaborn, Classification, Matplotlib, Shiny, Outlier, Classification, Neural Network... This is my libary for data preprocessing and sample of data sciences exercises.
Include many discipline:
- Bioinformatic
- Deep Learning
- Data Security & Analyst
- Algorithim

## Programing Languages:
### R for Data Science:
- A modern data science programing languages

#### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:
- R CRAN Project: R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS
- RStudio IDE: RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. Click here to see more RStudio features. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server or RStudio Server Pro (Debian/Ubuntu, Red Hat/CentOS, and SUSE Linux)

#### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development enviroment running:
* [Install R](https://www.r-project.org/) - If you haven't downloaded and installed R, here's how to get started.
* [R Studio IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#:~:text=RStudio%20Take%20control%20of%20your%20R%20code%20RStudio,tools%20for%20plotting,%20history,%20debugging%20and%20workspace%20management.) - After that choose R Studio Desktop, and the free version (unless you have the Pro install). R free version is pretty good IDE.

### Python for Data Science:
These are packages that are usually used for Data Science:
- [Python 3 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
- [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html)
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Mathplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html)

#### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Jupyter Notebook: If you want just test the code, simply go to google and search for jupiter notebook or another Python online IDE. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
- Anacoda Navigator: Install Anaconda Navigator if you want to develop data-science projects using Python or R. Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without the need to use command line commands. 

#### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development enviroment running
* [Install Anacoda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/#:~:text=Installing%20Navigator%20Navigator%20is%20automatically%20installed%20when%20you,install%20anaconda-navigator.%20To%20start%20Navigator,%20see%20Getting%20Started.) - If you haven't downloaded and installed Anacoda Navigator yet, here's how to get started.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) - Click here to go to the online free Jupiter Notebook.
