## Programming Languages:

### R for Data Science:

R is a modern programming language designed for data analysis and statistical computing. It offers a wide range of data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning capabilities.

#### Prerequisites:

To set up your environment, you will need:
- **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)**: Free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, compatible with multiple platforms (UNIX, Windows, macOS).
- **[RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/)**: An integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor, plotting tools, debugging, and workspace management.

#### Installing:

Hereâ€™s how to set up your development environment:
1. **[Install R](https://www.r-project.org/)** - Download and install R from the official website.
2. **[Install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#:~:text=RStudio%20Take%20control%20of%20your%20R%20code)** - Choose the RStudio Desktop version (the free version is highly capable for most use cases).

### Python for Data Science:

Python is a popular programming language for data science, with a rich ecosystem of libraries. Below are some commonly used packages for data science:

- **[Python 3 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)**: Comprehensive standard library documentation.
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html)**: A library for array and matrix operations.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html)**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

#### Prerequisites:

To set up Python for data science, you will need:
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **[Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/#:~:text=Installing%20Navigator%20Navigator%20is%20automatically%20installed%20when%20you)**: A desktop GUI for managing data science environments and packages without using the command line.

#### Installing:

Steps to install your development environment:
1. **[Install Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/#:~:text=Installing%20Navigator%20Navigator%20is%20automatically%20installed%20when%20you)** - Download and install Anaconda to get started with Python for data science.
2. **[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try)** - Use the free online Jupyter Notebook for testing code without installation.
